# tsp
An SLS solver for TSP.

## Preface
This TSP solver started out as a school project for an NUS module (CS4234 - Optimisation Algorithms). Mainly for our assignment, we tackled this Kattis problem; [tsp](https://open.kattis.com/problems/tsp), trying to get as high a score possible.

I spent lots of effort into developing this solver (about close to two months of intensive development), and didn't want to see my efforts go to waste. Thus, I've made my code public for anyone who might benefit from it. Feel free to send in PRs too, or fork this repository!

As of current development, the solver has reached state-of-the-art performance, scoring around 48.2/50 on average on Kattis!

## Future Work
The world record for this problem is currently at 48.7/50. Generally, it's going to be very hard to beat this record or even improve from here. But my goal is to get as close to 50 as possible for this problem on Kattis. Anyone wants to join me in my quest?
